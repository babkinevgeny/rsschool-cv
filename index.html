      <h3>Code examples</h3>
      <p>So, one of the latest interesting tasks was to write a functions to decode/encode rights in our work project. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/babkinevgeny/rightsEncoder">link to repository</a>. During this task I had known a lot about graphs, working with them, how we can store them in different data structures.</p>
      <p>When I had worked as html-coder as I created and supported site of that company. It's placed <a href="https://github.com/babkinevgeny/newzaoks">here</a>. This code is old one, but I think it's better to share with you.</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>I like Frontend because it's really thrilling me to create something new and to understand that I am a piece of something big and useful for people, for example, our working project for logistics. It's an app which is used by retailing giants like X5 Group and it's so inspiring to be participated in. So these things motivate me to improve my skills and become better every day.</p>
