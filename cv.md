### Experience
I'm working in this sphere almost 3 years. My current position is Junior Fullstack Developer. My duties are to implement new features, fix bugs. To clarify our company produces an app for logistics support. Before that I had been working for 2 years as HTML-coder in a small company. My work was to implement new features to their web site and support it.
### Skills
I have an experience in web site creation about 3 years. In my work I use **Pug** as a html template engine, **SCSS** as CSS preprocessor, **Gulp** as a task manager. Of course I use **JavaScript** in my work, had a few tasks to do in **TypeScript**. Have experience working with SQL databases. As database management system in my work I use PostgreSQL. Also have a little experience in Node.js and React.
### Code examples
So, one of the latest interesting tasks was to write a functions to decode/encode rights in our work project.  
Here is the [link to repository](https://github.com/babkinevgeny/rightsEncoder).  
During this task I had known a lot about graphs, working with them, how we can store them in different data structures.  
You can find more code examples in my [github account](https://github.com/babkinevgeny).
### Summary
I like Frontend because it's really thrilling me to create something new and to understand that I am a piece of something big and useful for people, for example, our working project for logistics. It's an app which is used by retailing giants like X5 Group and it's so inspiring to be participated in. So these things motivate me to improve my skills and become better every day.
